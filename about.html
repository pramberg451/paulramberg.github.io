        <p>The Kirksville Art Association is the center for the arts in Kirksville, Missouri.
                In December of 1995, two groups joined forces to become the Kirksville Arts
                 Association. The Red Barn Community Art League was founded in 1973. Its 
                 focus was the Red Barn Festival. Later, the Kirksville Regional Arts Council 
                 was founded.  It focused on other arts activities, including arts education. 
                  The merger helped both organizations to support more programs and to reach 
                  more people.
